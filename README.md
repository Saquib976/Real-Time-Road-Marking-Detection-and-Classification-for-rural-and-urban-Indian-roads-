# ðŸš§ Real-Time-Road-Marking-Detection-and-Classification-for-rural-and-urban-Indian-roads-
 
## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project focuses on real-time detection and classification of road markings (like lane dividers, pedestrian crossings, arrows, etc.) on rural and semi-urban Indian roads. We use low-cost edge AI devices such as Raspberry Pi or Jetson Nano and lightweight models like YOLOv8-nano or MobileNet.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Key Features
- Detect road markings in poor lighting, dust, and faded conditions.
- Real-time inference on edge AI devices.
- GPS-tagged outputs for road mapping and maintenance alerts.
- Custom dataset from Indian rural and semi-urban roads.

---

## ðŸ§  Model & Architecture
We use YOLOv8-Nano for real-time detection with minimal latency. The model is optimized for edge devices using ONNX/TensorRT.

## ðŸ—‚ Dataset
- Custom images collected from rural and semi-urban Indian roads.
- Annotations done using CVAT.
- Augmentations include blur, fading, brightness, and cracks.
